<h1>limmaGUI Worked Example : Bob Mutant Data Set</h1>

<p><b>Background</b>. This data is from a study of transcription factors
critical to B cell maturation by Lynn Corcoran and Wendy Dietrich at the WEHI.
Mice which have a targeted mutation in the Bob (OBF-1) transcription factor
display a number of abnormalities in the B lymphocyte compartment of the immune
system. Immature B cells that have emigrated from the bone marrow fail to
differentiate into full fledged B cells, resulting in a notable deficit of
mature B cells.</p>
<p><b>Arrays</b>. Arrays were printed with expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from
the National Institute of Aging 15k mouse clone library, plus a range of
positive, negative and calibration controls. The arrays were printed using a 48
tip print head and 26x26 spots in each tip group. Data from 24 of the tip groups
are given here. Every gene (ESTs and controls) was printed twice on each array.</p>
<p><b>Hybridizations</b>. A retrovirus was used to add Bob back to a Bob
deficient cell line. Two RNA sources were compared using 2 dye-swap pairs of
microarrays. One RNA source was obtained from the Bob deficient cell line after
the retrovirus was used to add GFP (&quot;green fluorescent protein&quot;, a neutral
protein). The other RNA source was obtained after adding both GFP and Bob
protein. RNA from Bob+GFP was labelled with Cy5 in arrays 2 and 4, and with Cy3
in arrays 1 and 4.</p>

<p>For this example, you will need the file BobArraysLoaded.lma, which can be downloaded from
<a href="http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limmaGUI/DataSets.html">http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limmaGUI/DataSets.html</a>.<br>
</p>

<h2>Opening the Data Set</h2>
<p>From the file menu, select Open.</p>
<img src="OpenSelected.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Open the file, BobArraysLoaded.lma.  This file can be downloaded from the URL given above.  Advanced
users may be interested to know that a Limma (.lma) file is really just an RData file, so it can easily
be loaded into an R session.  However, it may appear more complicated than standard RData files
associated with the limma package because it allows for multiple parameterizations and stores
them in a list data structure called <code>ParameterizationList</code>.</p>
<img src="OpeningBobLimma.jpg"><br><br>
<p>After loading Bob.lma, have a look at the RNA targets by clicking on "RNA Targets" in the
"RNA Targets" menu.</p>
<img src="RNATargets.jpg"><br><br>
<p>You can also check the array layout by clicking on "Layout Parameters" in the "Layout" menu.</p>
<img src="layout.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Upon opening BobArraysLoaded.lma, it is evident that one parameterization is available, "Bob GFP" (containing
one parameter), and that no linear model fit has been computed yet.</p>
<img src="BobLimmaLoaded.jpg"><br><br>


<h2>Computing a Linear Model Fit</h2>
<p>Click on "Compute Linear Model Fit" in the Linear Model menu.</p>
<img src="ComputeLinearModelFitSelected.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Select "No".  We don't need to create a new parameterization, as we already have the "Bob GFP"
parameterization.</p>
<img src="CreateNewParameterizationNo.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Click OK to select the "Bob GFP" parameterization.</p>
<img src="ChooseParameterization.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Click "Yes" to normalize within arrays.</p>
<img src="NormalizeWithinArrays.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Use the default within-array normalization method (print-tip group loess).</p>
<img src="ChooseNormalizationMethod.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Click "No" to avoid normalizing between arrays.</p>
<img src="NormalizeBetweenArraysNo.jpg"><br><br>
<p>The number of duplicates for this data set is 2, i.e. each gene is printed twice on each array.
The duplicate pairs are adjacent to each other on the array, so the spacing between them is just 1.</p>
<img src="NumberDuplicates.jpg"><br><br>
<p>If you never estimate the correlation between duplicates for a data set, you should let limmaGUI do it
the first time (which could take a very long time).  In the future, you may prefer to estimate this correlation
yourself to save time.  Typically, the duplicate correlation will be between 0.5 and 1.</p>
<img src="CalculateDupCor.jpg"><br><br>
<p>After a LONG wait, the duplicate correlation is displayed in a message box, indicating that the
correlation analysis and linear model fitting is complete.  (It can be viewed later
on in the Linear Model Fits drill-down box on the main limmaGUI window.</p>
<img src="DupCorMB.jpg"><br><br>
<p>The drill-down in the Parameterizations window now shows that the linear model fit has been computed and
that the duplicate correlation is available.</p>
<img src="LinearModelComputed.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Now might be a good time to save a Limma (.lma) file.</p>
<img src="SaveAsSelected.jpg"><br><br>
<p>The same data set can be saved at different stages of the analysis using different file names.</p>
<img src="SavingBobLinearModelComputed.jpg"><br><br>
<p>From the "Plot" menu, click on "Duplicate Correlation Box Plot".</p>
<p>There is only one parameterization, so click OK.</p>
<img src="ChooseParameterization.jpg"><br><br>
<p>A box plot showing the range of correlations for duplicate spots is shown below.</p>
<img src="DupCorBoxPlot.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Click on "Table of Genes Ranked in order of Differential Expression" in the "TopTable" menu.</p>
<img src="ToptableSelected.jpg"><br><br>
<p>There is only one parameterization, so click OK.</p>
<img src="ChooseParameterization.jpg"><br><br>
<p>There is only one parameter, so click OK.</p>
<img src="ChooseParameter.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Leave the toptable options (not shown) at their default values and click OK.
The resulting table is shown below.</p>
<img src="Toptable.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Now click on "Log Odds Plot" in the Plot menu.</p>
<img src="LogOddsPlotSelected.jpg"><br><br>
<p>There is only one parameterization, so click OK.</p>
<img src="ChooseParameterization.jpg"><br><br>
<p>There is only one parameter, so click OK.</p>
<img src="ChooseParameter.jpg"><br><br>
<p>For this plot, we will not label any of the top differentially expressed genes.</p>
<img src="ZeroDEgeneLabels.jpg"><br><br>
<p>The log odds plot is shown below.</p>
