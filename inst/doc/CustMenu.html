<h1>Customizing the menus in limmaGUI (for Advanced users)</h1>

<p>The pull-down menus in limmaGUI are defined in <code>limmaGUI-menus.txt</code> in the <code>etc</code>
subdirectory of the <code>limmaGUI</code> package installation.  To find out exactly where this directory
is on your computer, you can paste the following into R:</p>
<pre>
system.file(&quot;etc&quot;,package=&quot;limmaGUI&quot;)
</pre>
<p>R source files can be added to this <code>etc</code> directory (and must have extension <code>.R</code>).</p>

<p>Try uncommenting (i.e. removing the # from) the histogram menu item in <code>limmaGUI-menus.txt</code>
to enable the histogram command in the plot menu.</p>

<p>You can add as many menu items as you wish.</p>

<p>The reason that the histogram example plots the graph in the standard R graphics device rather than in a Tk
window is simply to keep this example brief and avoid calling <code>tkrplot</code>.  Generally graphs are plotted
in Tk windows and users of the Windows operating system can keep their main RGui window minimized while they
run <code>limmaGUI</code>.</p>
